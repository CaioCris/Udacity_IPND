						Everything in the web are <span class="it">BOXES</span>

					<p>
						YEAH! that is right! Everything we see in the browser are invisible boxes made by HTML tag (the block tags) and with CSS we add some style to the page with color, position to imagens, position to this boxes and etc.

					<p>
						Because of this boxes division it's very important divide your sections in the HTML file.

							CSS methods
						</h3>
						<p>
							CSS is Cascating Style Sheet, it's a good way to avoid repetition, the better explanation for that is the method 3 who has a lot of repetition, you can give style to your HTML in the most variabel ways, can be really specific about what you want, or what tags do you want to change in the box, even if you want to give a style for just one word in the hole code.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="b">DIV</span> - In this kind of tag you can apply style for to a box of information.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="b">SPAN</span> - In this kind of tag you can apply style to a line or one unique value in your HTML code.

							<li>Border: The border is around the <span class="it">padding</span> and is the part who get the background attributes and colors.
							</li>
							<li>Padding: When you do a div tag, you make a "invisible box" around the <span class="it">Content</span>, his name is padding.

							Code, test and refine

						<p>
							First of all you need to do your layout, which is the page structure based in the visually boxing of the designer project than you start to work on tags, after you work on the boxes size and for the last you position on the screen.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Look for natural boxes
							</li>
							<li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
							</li>
							<li>Write your HTML

							<li>Apply style with CSS - Biggest to smaller
